>     Attendence Video Player for FPGA class
Because of the corona virus, all classes are being replaced remotely.
So, I developed a video player program to check attendance remotely.

Video Library (OpenCV) and Audio Library (ffpyplayer) based Video Player.
It required student infomation and your gmail account, gmail auth password.
